# Hill Cipher Encryption App

This app is part of the final course project for 32010: Linear Algebra
as part of the Masters of Analyics graduate program at the University
of Chicago. 

The Hill Cipher works by multiplying a list of numbers by a key matrix
to encode it, then multiplying by the inverse matrix to decode it. This
app demonstrates that cipher in action.
